We advise you to go through [color=e69719][b]mini-tutorial on the game.[/b][/color]
It is represented by 9 visual slides (this is the first one).

You can navigate between slides by flipping through them (as usual).
Double clicking on the screen also works (clicking on the left means
transition to previous slide, on the right means transition to next slide).

To exit the mini-tutorial, press the [color=e69719][b]"back"[/b][/color] button.

This mini-tutorial can always be opened in the section [color=e69719][b]"Game guide".[/b][/color]
There is also [color=e69719][b]Brief game help[/color][/b] - it will be useful to you during the first games.

We also recommend reading the full rules, but it's better to do this already
after a couple of games played, when you would learn the basics.
