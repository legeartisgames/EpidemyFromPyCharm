This is the end of the training.
Press "back" on the device to exit it. If you have just opened "Epidemy", 
you will find yourself in the game splash screen.

To start playing, click on the "Start gaming!", select infection, country and game mode.

Our tip: if you are playing for the first time, choose
[color=e69719][b]Monkey pox, Universal country[/b][/color] and mode [color=e69719][b]"Penalty limit Ñ…5"[/b][/color].
This will make your first game easier.
