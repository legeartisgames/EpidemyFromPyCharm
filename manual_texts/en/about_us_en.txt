We ([b][color=e69719]Legeartis Games[/b][/color]) are a team of Russian mobile game developers.
"Epidemy: The Outbreak" has been developed by us since August 2020. It is written in Python3 using the Kivy library. We also use MatplotLib for making charts.

"Epidemy: The Outbreak" is a simulation game that aims to explain how the epidemic spreads. Using our proposed model (albeit imperfect), it is possible to analyze, among other things, the Covid-19 pandemic.

We have not yet managed to achieve complete realism, but the game already allows you to understand how important it is not to be late in making a decision during an epidemic. You are often faced with the choice of what to do: prevent the economy from collapsing or try to stop the spread of the epidemic; invest in research to learn how to treat people from infection in the future, or in hospitals to save those already sick.
