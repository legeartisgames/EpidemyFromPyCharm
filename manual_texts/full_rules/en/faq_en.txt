[b][color=e69719]Will there be an Apple version of the app?[/b][/color]

     It will definitely not be until the project brings in $100 in advertising. Apple Store developer account is very expensive.

[b][color=e69719]How can I support the project?[/b][/color]

    1) give 5 stars to the game on Google Play and write a sincere review

    2) tell your family and friends about the game, write about it in social media

    3) join the game community in Facebook, suggest your ideas and share your successes with others

    4) you can use the "Get money" option (in Additional menu). Google pays relatively well for rewarded videos

[b][color=e69719]Will there be payments in the app?[/b][/color]

    In the near future no. "Epidemy: The Oubreak" is completely free.

[b][color=e69719]Why is such a strange set of states in the game?[/b][/color]

    Let's say it happened so historically. In the future, other states will be added to the game. We promise to add 3 new countries if the app gets 10000 downloads on Google Play.

[b][color=e69719]What is the profitability of the project?[/b][/color]

    So far zero. Funds for advertising are transferred by $100 portions. At the moment, about 60 cents have been "earned".

[b][color=e69719]Why is the author of the game not the publisher of the game on Google Play?[/b][/color]

    Google Play does not allow minors to register a developer account on Google Play.

[b][color=e69719]Why is the English version of the app so ridiculous sometimes?[/b][/color]

    Ask Google Translate. The translation of the app was made with its help. If you find any absurdity in the translation, please write us about it.
