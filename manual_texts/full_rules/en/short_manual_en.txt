[b][color=e69719]How to play[/b][/color]

Your goal is to stop the epidemic in the country. The best way to do this is to research a medicine or vaccine. To do this, you will have to get the methods of fighting the epidemic (from the methods panel), and then use them.

The game is split into turns, i.e. months. When you end a turn (we can say that the end of a turn is a "phase of the passage of time" in the game), the number of ill and dead people changes, the country receives income, and the one-turn effects of methods ("only for this turn ...") stop working.

[b][color=e69719]Hex-regions[/b][/color]: the country in the game consists of numbered regions. They are indicated by hexes. In each hex, 4 colored circles are drawn on the right - they indicate the state of the 4 infectious parameters of the region (see their value in the center of the hex in the white boxes).

[b][color=e69719]Actions with the country map[/b][/color]: the size and position of the map change with finger movements (as always on the phone).

[b][color=e69719]Typical structure of the methods card[/b][/color] (from top to bottom): name, cost of the method, description of the game effect from getting the method, button for getting the method.

[b][color=e69719]Types of methods[/b][/color]:

    - ordinary (gotten - got something)

    - investments (you can "get it" as many times as you like, from each investment a constant effect)

    - with activation (there is an effect if the method is gotten and activated. Then there will be a "Deactivate method" button the left of the method card).

    - for the region (you get it, then spend some money on the region and get the effect on this region. "if you spend x coins on the region ...").

[b][color=e69719]How to apply the method to the region/regions[/b][/color]:

- in the corresponding method card, select the number of the desired region through "+" and "-" and click "Make!"

- or double-click the hex you need and select the method you need in the drop-down menu (if you go to "Region data", then the graph will be offered there).

- or use "Multiselect" option:
    * have this button turn on
    * click on the hexes (the blue circle at the bottom right of the hex indicates that the region is selected)
    * press "Enter", and then select in the drop-down menu what you need (you can also select the plotting there).

[b][color=e69719]Designations[/b][/color]:

[b][color=e69719]z_out[/color][/b] - the overall incidence rate in the country (see its influence below)
[b][color=e69719]d_out[/color][/b] - the overall mortality rate for the country (see its influence below)

[b][color=e69719]z_in[/color][/b] - the incidence rate in the region: the number of patients on the next turn in the region = z_in * z_out * the number of patients on the current turn (the transfer coefficient also has a positive effect on this)
[b][color=e69719]d_in[/color][/b] - mortality rate in the region (d_in * d_out * number of patients = number of deaths per turn in a hex)
[b][color=e69719]Ill [/color][/b] - the number of patients in this region-hex
[b][color=e69719]Dead[/color][/b] - number of deaths in this region-hex

[b][color=e69719]Income[/color][/b] - after each turn, the number of coins in the assets of your country increases by the value of income.
[b][color=e69719]coins (Coins)[/color][/b] - the size of the country's assets, i.e. the amount of funds in your country.

[b][color=e69719]Spread coefficient[/color][/b] (aka [b][color=e69719]Spread[/b][/color]) - the value at a high value of which the number of patients in the region increases greatly in the neighboring regions.

[color=1ea814][b]Victory points[/color][/b] - if you get 5 victory points, you will win.
[color=e02d33][b]Penalty points[/color][/b] - if you get 25 penalty points (or some other number - see the second number in the "Penalty points" section of the panel on the left), then you will lose.
